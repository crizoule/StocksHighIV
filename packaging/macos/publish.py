    notes = '''A new Market leverage panel sits below Macro sentiment. It shows how much investors are borrowing, from six free public sources: FINRA margin debt, the Fed's Z.1 margin loans against US stock market value, hedge-fund leverage from the OFR's Form PF data, hedge funds' S&P 500 futures positions from the CFTC, trading in 3× leveraged ETFs as a daily retail proxy, and the Fed's Financial Stability Report.

Each card gives the period its data covers, when that release came out, and when the next one is due: the publisher's own date where one is announced, otherwise an estimate from the source's usual rhythm, flagged as due once it passes. Readings are ranked against their own history, and the top fifth is marked elevated. Below the cards, the same S&P 500 chart as the sentiment panel plots any of seven leverage series, back to 1987 where the data reaches.

On September 24 all six sources answered: margin debt $1.45T, up 37% in a year; hedge funds 2.57× gross assets to net assets, 8.59× counting derivatives, the highest in the OFR's series since 2013. The panel and both charts fill in on the first data refresh after updating.

Mac 1.1.0+ and packaged Windows 1.2.0+ users can use Check for Updates. Updates preserve watchlists, settings, and saved market data.

For a new installation, download the ZIP for your platform, extract it, and open StocksHighIV.app or StocksHighIV.exe. Requires Python 3.11+. The Mac app is signed and Apple-notarized. Windows supports Windows 10/11 x64; the executable is not Authenticode-signed.'''
