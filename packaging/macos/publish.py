    notes = '''The AAII chart now shows its bullish, neutral and bearish lines straight after updating. Reports saved by 2.8.0 or earlier held only the bull–bear spread, and the app redraws a saved report with its saved data, so 2.9.0 kept showing the single spread line until a full data refresh. The three lines are now rebuilt from AAII's bundled history and the weeks you entered.

The put/call chart no longer has a hole from October 2019 to March 2022. The app stores Cboe's daily figures after its 2003–2019 archive, and it only filled older ones when the Fear & Greed replica was rebuilt, at most every six hours. On a new installation that left about 600 sessions missing for days. They now fill on every refresh, and until the gap closes the chart names how many sessions are still missing and between which dates.

Mac 1.1.0+ and packaged Windows 1.2.0+ users can use Check for Updates. Updates preserve watchlists, settings, and saved market data.

For a new installation, download the ZIP for your platform, extract it, and open StocksHighIV.app or StocksHighIV.exe. Requires Python 3.11+. The Mac app is signed and Apple-notarized. Windows supports Windows 10/11 x64; the executable is not Authenticode-signed.'''
