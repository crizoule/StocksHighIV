    notes = '''A refresh no longer re-downloads quotes that cannot have changed. Cboe's delayed feed sometimes stays on the previous close well into a trading day — on September 23 it did so from the open until at least 1:30 PM ET — and the app used to spend about 45 minutes fetching thousands of identical quotes because the market was nominally open.

A single request for SPY now decides which session Cboe is serving, whatever the clock reads. Measured against the live feed: 2,248 of 2,253 quotes reused, 5.5 seconds instead of about 41 minutes. When the feed has rolled to the current session, every quote is downloaded as before, since those move.

Reuse needs quotes that are final, meaning downloaded after their own session's close, so the 4:30 PM ET schedule gets the most from it. Montréal Exchange quotes are unchanged: their page carries no reliable session date.

Mac 1.1.0+ and packaged Windows 1.2.0+ users can use Check for Updates. Updates preserve watchlists, settings, and saved market data.

For a new installation, download the ZIP for your platform, extract it, and open StocksHighIV.app or StocksHighIV.exe. Requires Python 3.11+. The Mac app is signed and Apple-notarized. Windows supports Windows 10/11 x64; the executable is not Authenticode-signed.'''
